# DVM - Design and Build a Two Range Voltmeter using the Arduino.
## Intro
Get hands-on experience with a Digital Voltmeter using
- Resistor divider
- PhotoMOS switches
- Low-pass filter
- Ardiuno's UNO's ADC  

Specifications
- Two voltage ranges: +4V and +20V.
- Pushbutton selects voltage range
- Accuracy
	- 4V Range: Verror = ±15mV ±1.5% of Reading
	- 20V Range: Verror = ±75mV ±1.5% of Reading  

Files for all key project phases include
- Specifications
- Circuit schematic
- Design equations
- Error Budget Analysis
- Excel calculators
- SPICE simulations
- Flowhart and Arduino code
- Test forms and results tracker
